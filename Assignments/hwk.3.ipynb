Your function will generate a **basins of attraction plot**, i.e. at each point $z_0$ in the plot you will compute a solution to the above ODE satisfying the initial condition $z(0)=z_0$.  Depending on the behaviour of the solution you will color the point $z_0$ accordingly.  You will choose colours according to each of the roots.  If your solution converges to a root, colour the point $z_0$ accordingly.  Similarly, choose a colour for initial values $z_0$ corresponding to periodic solutions.  And colour the point $z_0$ black if it does neither. \n",
